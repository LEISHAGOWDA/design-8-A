<p><span class="auto-style27">Dia de Sant Jordi is the most important festivals 
of Barcelona. This festival of Barcelona is celebrated on the 23rd of April 
every year and this festival can also be called the highlight of April in 
Barcelona. The day of Dia de Sant Jordi celebrates the Patron Saint of 
Barcelona, Eulalia, who was a 13 year old Roman Christian virgin known for being 
oppressed in the city of Barcelona during the time when the Christians where 
persecuted in the reign of emperor diocletian. On this day, the whole of Las 
Ramblas, a well known street in Central Barcelona is made into a flower street. 
The reason behind transforming this street into a flower stall is that men 
should show their appreciation for women through these flowers as a act of going 
against Eulalia's case in the past.</span><br class="auto-style27" />
